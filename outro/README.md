# ONE PIECE OUTRO USING MANIM

This repository contains a custom font designed to replicate the iconic "To Be Continued" end screen from One Piece anime. The font was created using **FontForge** and **Inkscape** and is tailored specifically for rendering the phrase **"TO BE CONTINUED"** with proper spacing and alignment.

## Font Details
- The font only includes the necessary letters required for the phrase "TO BE CONTINUED."
- The key mappings are customized due to same letters having two different styles, like "T" in "TO" looks different than the "T" in "CONTINUED".
  - `T = T`
  - `O = O`
  - `B = B`
  - `E = E`
  - `C = C`
  - `O = o`
  - `N = N`
  - `T = t`
  - `I = I`
  - `N = n`
  - `U = U`
  - `E = e`
  - `D = D`
- The **spacebar** key is also customized within the font to ensure proper spacing in the phrase.

## Usage
1. Download and install the included `onepiece.ttf` font file.
2. Use it in any design or animation software to recreate the "To Be Continued" text.
3. Works seamlessly with **Manim** or any other rendering engine that supports custom fonts.
