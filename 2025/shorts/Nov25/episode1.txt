Micro storyboard and timing (total ~30–35s)

0.0–2.0s Hook

  Big top text: "Multiply 23 × 11 in 5 seconds?"

  Quick pop of the problem centered.

2.0–6.0s Show method with one example

  Visual: write 2 3 with a gap between digits.

  Voice: "Write the two digits with a space between them."

6.0–14.0s Reveal trick

  Visual step: show the middle digit as sum 2+3 = 5, place it between them to form 2 5 3.

  Voice: "Add the digits, put the sum in the middle. 2 plus 3 equals 5, so 23 times 11 equals 253."

14.0–20.0s Show edge cases

  Visual: show 58 × 11 -> 5 + 8 = 13, carry the 1 to left: result 638.

  Voice: "If the sum is two digits, carry over to the left."

20.0–28.0s Quick practice challenge + CTA

  Visual: flash 47 × 11 and 99 × 11 quickly, hold answers for 1.5s each.
